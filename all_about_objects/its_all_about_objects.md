# Its all about Objects

This chapter will give a quick introduction in the concepts of object oriented programming (OOP). While not explicitly necessary, this chapter does assume you have some basic knowledge about OOP and programming. If not, please review the GitBook course "Object Oriented Programming with Java" which can be found at https://bioboost.gitbooks.io/object-oriented-programming-using-java/content/.

While this chapter serves as an introduction to the course, it will also provide an overview of the concepts thought in this course. Most concepts given in this chapter will be discussed in detail further in the course. So this chapter will provide the big picture of OOP and connect all the different chapters. If you do not understand some of the parts in this chapter, do not panic, keep reading and return here after advancing further in the book.

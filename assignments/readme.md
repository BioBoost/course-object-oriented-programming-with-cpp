# Assignments

The assignments you need to make will be provided to you by GitHub ClassRoom. GitHub Classroom automates repository creation and access control, making it easy to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub.

For each assignment an invitation link will be provided via Slack #oop_with_cpp which you need to accept. After accepting the invitation you will receive access to a personal copy of the starter repository. This is a general Git repository to which you can commit your solution to the assignment. The assignment is described in detail inside the README.md file.

The first time you accept the invitation you will need to select your account. Make sure to select the correct user. Wrong user = no grades!

### Adding Data - Attributes

#### Modeling a dog

Model a dog by creating a class `Dog` and add attributes for:
* its age
* its color
* its breed
* its name
* its weight

You can choose the datatypes yourself (pick reasonable ones).

How would you call the header file? Make sure to add an include guard.

# Basics of Classes

Classes are the central feature of C++ that support the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. They are often called user-defined types. Classes are the representation of elements from the problem space inside the solution space. They combine both data and methods into one neat package (also known as **encapsulation**).

The data and methods within a class are called members of the class.

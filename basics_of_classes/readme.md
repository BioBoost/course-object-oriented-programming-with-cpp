# Basics of Classes

Classes are the central feature of C++ that support the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. They are often called user-defined types. Classes are the representation of elements from the problem space inside the solution space. They combine both **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) into one neat little package (also known as **encapsulation**).

In C++ the attributes and methods within a class are called the **members** of that class.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43176681/do-statically-linked-libraries-require-linking-with-their-dependencies

I'm building an executable that depends on a static library A which in turn depends on a static library B. When I build my application, do I need to also link against B in my build script?

To be more specific, do I need to do -la -lb, or, just linking with A via -la is enough?





ANWER:

If both A and B are static, then you have to link both, in order of A then B (-la -lb). See this reply for an explanation of the order.

A statically linked program includes the libraries its linked against inside of the executable.

Imagine your program calls foo() inside of A, and somewhere inside of A, bar() gets called. So if A becomes part of your program, you then have an undefined call to bar() in your program, which is why you need to link against B as well.



Our Example:

TLC example depends on TLC which depends on I2CEndPoint

Makefile of example: LIBS=-li2cendpoint -ltlc59116

## Chapter 04 - Basics of Classes - Exercises

### Die Throwing (continued)

Take the "Die Throwing" application from the exercises of chapter 3.

Refactor the code to make use of a class `Die`. Make sure to add a `roll()` method to your class.

If you change the number of sides on your die from `6` to `20`. Do you need to change your implementation of `Die`? If so, refactor the class to be independent of the lower and upper limit. You should even be able to create a `Die` that can generate values from `10` to `16` for example.

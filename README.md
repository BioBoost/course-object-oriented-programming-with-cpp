# Object Oriented Programming with C++

Welcome to the course Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++. In this course we will try to learn to become good or better OOP programmers. While the concepts can be extended to most other OOP languages, some examples may only be usable as is.

The course will also contain some specifics for mBed platforms as they can be programmed in C++. This means that some exercises can only be made on the mBed platform (if there are hardware dependencies).

Most of the material used in this course is created by Nico De Witte. However some paragraphs, definitions, examples, images, ... may be copied from other online sources. In that case a reference can be found in the Sources chapter or as a footnote.

## Requirements

To follow along you will need at least a C++ compiler for the operating system you are using. Best option is to use a GCC compiler. If you are a total beginner for C++ a good option can be Code::Blocks, a simple and free C++ IDE.

The exercises for mBed can be developed online at https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/ or using the offline toolchain https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/dev_tools/cli/

## About this course

This course is not about learning to use all sorts of tools or fancy integrated development environments (IDEs). It's also not about learning to manage projects or design methodologies.

The main focus lies in learning to think in an object oriented way and in the meantime learn some object oriented languages. While learning all these great things about objects we are not responsible for the fact that you might learn a thing or two about tools and project management. A second focus is to learn to use an embedded system such as the mBed and learn some hardware programming skills.

### Theory

While all you need to know for the exam is in this course, not all you should know is in here. It is extremely preferable to take notes in the lessons. And of course you are also encouraged to search the Internet and books for extra knowledge.

Feel free to ask questions in the lessons, via email or via slack.

### LABs, assignments and tests

The LABs are there to practice what you have learned in the theory lessons. You will get some assignments through the semester on which you will be graded.

This course also contains extra exercises to practice your OOP skills in either Java or C++ (or another language of your preference).

There may be occasions for tests but these will mostly be announced.

### ECTS

For the exact details on the LABs, exams and tests you should take a look at the ECTS fiche of this course.

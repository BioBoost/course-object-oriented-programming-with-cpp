# Guide - Linked List

Like arrays, linked lists allow the **storage of data elements** of any data type in an sequential manner. Unlike arrays, the elements of a linked list are **not stored at contiguous locations in memory**, the **elements are linked one after another using pointers**.

::: tip Definition
A **linked list** is a dynamically allocated **linear data structure** that chains together **nodes** by **linking** from one node to another using pointers.

## Why Linked Lists are so Important

The concept of a linked list is important to learn for two reasons:

* First, linked lists are data structures that are used in real life applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of such data structures is really important. These insights will give you an appreciation and deeper understanding of processing performance, memory consumption and other code issues.
* Secondly, linked lists are probable the best way to learn about pointers. In fact, you may never implement a linked list yourself in a real application, but you are sure to use pointers. Linked list problems are a good combination of algorithms and pointer manipulations. Traditionally, linked lists have been the domain where beginning programmers get the practice to really understand pointers.

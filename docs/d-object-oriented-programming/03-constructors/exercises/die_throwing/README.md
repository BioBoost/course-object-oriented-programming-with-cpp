# Die Throwing

Create a `Die` class for a `6` sided die. Implement a `roll()` method that returns a random number between `1` and `6`.

Create a small demo app that demonstrates the usage of the class `Die`. Roll the die a couple of times using a `for` construct.

Now refactor the `Die` class so the `6` limit is not a magic number anymore. Make sure it can be passed via the `Die` constructor of the class. This way you should be able to create a 6-sided die or a 20-sided die.

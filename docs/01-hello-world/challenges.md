## Chapter 01 - Hello World - Challenges

### Personal Information

Alter the "Hello World" application to display some more text. Add some personal information about yourself. Can you also output literal integers. How would you go about chaining pieces of information into a single `cout` statement?

### endl

What does `endl` do? It is often found after outputting some information to the terminal.

### The standard namespace

Try leaving out the `using namespace std;` statement. Can you alter the "Hello World" application to work without using the `using namespace std;` statement?
